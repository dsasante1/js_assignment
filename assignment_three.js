// Exercise 3: Calculate the compound interest and display a savings summary

// Step 1: Define variables for principal amount, interest rate, and time period


// Step 2: Calculate the compound interest using the formula: A = P * (1 + r/n)^(nt)


// Step 3: Round the compound interest to 2 decimal places using the toFixed() method


// Step 4: Display the compound interest


// Step 5: Update the interest rate by decrementing it by 0.01 using the decrement operator


// Step 6: Calculate the new compound interest with the updated interest rate


// Step 7: Calculate the difference between the new and previous compound interests


// Step 8: Display the new compound interest and the difference compared to the previous interest


// Step 9: Convert the compound interest to a string and extract the cents using string methods


// Step 10: Display the extracted cents from the compound interest


// Step 11: Calculate the total amount by adding the principal and compound interest


// Step 12: Display the total amount using string interpolation and the toLocaleString() method
